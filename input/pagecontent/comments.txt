    - Granularity of communication / interactivity
        - in addition to time
        - related to the previous concept regarding 'frequency'
    - Dynamically interactive vs handoff
        - handoff: one app is 'done' and no further action expected
        - Dynamically interaction: continuous update is expected between applications
- TODO: Transient vs Persistent - clarify text
- TODO: Add a concept section about event
    - e.g. standard and custom events
    - event maturity in FHIRcast

        - Make an OQ if any behavior should be mandatory / baseline
- Note: exercise with clincians about for each event, what is the response behavior for each actor. (how well do we foresee loose coupling to work)
