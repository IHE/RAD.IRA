- 4 layers
    - Session: Can launch other applications and generate a new reporting session (i.e. generate a new session ID)
    - Context: Can initiate or terminate report context
    - Content: Can update and select report content to a given context
    - Event: Can consume all events according to its business logic
- Actors:
    - Watcher: Req - Event
    - Image Display: Req - Event, Context, Session
    - Evidence Creator: Req - Event
    - Report Creator: Req - Event, Context, Session
    - Worklist Display: Req - Event, Context, Session
    - Hub: All levels as a manager
    - Report Content Creator: Req - Content
- Every application shall be able to start a reporting session (i.e. generate the session ID)
- For Evidence Creator actor description, add more specific expectation what outputs it can produce.
- Navigation (series / image level), does it need X5 and X6?
- Add Watcher actor (same as Synchronizing Application, no contribution, just consume)
- SMART on FHIR client side behavior needs to be added to other actors as a client behavior as well
- check IUA
- 1:XX.2.1: Missing an option introduction line.
- Add SMART on FHIR as an open question
- Data Model:
    - Separate the data model from the interaction model
        - For the data model, on the side, explain how the model maps to a reporting session
    - Add selected content to the diagram
- 1:XX.4.1.3
    - Rewrite the first paragraph
        - focus on use case in a reporting
        - look at 4.1.1
- Add a concept section about Driving Application and Synchronizing Application
- 1:XX.4.1.6
    - Granularity of communication / interactivity
        - in addition to time
        - related to the previous concept regarding 'frequency'
    - Dynamically interactive vs handoff
        - handoff: one app is 'done' and no further action expected
        - Dynamically interaction: continuous update is expected between applications
- TODO: Transient vs Persistent - clarify text
